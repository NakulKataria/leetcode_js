Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.


solution
Track last occurrences: Store the last index of each character in lastOccurrence so we know if it appears later.
If a character is already in the stack, skip it.
While the stackâ€™s top character is greater than the current character and it appears later in the string, remove it to ensure lexicographical order.
Return the stack as a string.
