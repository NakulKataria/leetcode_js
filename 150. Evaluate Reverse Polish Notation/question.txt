You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:

The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
There will not be any division by zero.
The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.


solution
Process operators: When encountering an operator:
Pop the last two numbers (b, then a).
Perform the operation a (op) b and push the result back onto the stack.
Handle division correctly: Use Math.trunc(a / b) to ensure truncation toward zero.
Final result: The last value in the stack is the answer.
